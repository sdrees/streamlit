## Version 0.48.0

_Release date: October 12, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- 🔧 Ability to set config options as command line flags or in a local config file.
- ↕️ You can now maximize charts and images!
- ⚡ Streamlit is now much faster when writing data in quick succession to your app.
- ✳️ Ability to blacklist folder globs from "run on save" and `@st.cache` hashing.
- 🎛️ Improved handling of widget state when Python file is modified.
- 🙈 Improved HTML support in `st.write` and `st.markdown`. HTML is still unsafe, though!

**Notable bug fixes:**

- Fixes `@st.cache` bug related to having your Python environment on current
  working directory. [Issue #242](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/242)
- Fixes loading of root url `/` on Windows. [Issue #244](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/244)

## Version 0.47.0

_Release date: October 1, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- 🌄 New hello.py showing off 4 glorious Streamlit apps. Try it out!
- 🔄 Streamlit now automatically selects an unused port when 8501 is already in use.
- 🎁 Sidebar support is now out of beta! Just start any command with `st.sidebar.` instead of `st.`
- ⚡ Performance improvements: we added a cache to our websocket layer so we no longer re-send data to the browser when it hasn't changed between runs
- 📈 Our "native" charts `st.line_chart`, `st.area_chart` and `st.bar_chart` now use Altair behind the scenes
- 🔫 Improved widgets: custom st.slider labels; default values in multiselect
- 🕵️‍♀️ The filesystem watcher now ignores hidden folders and virtual environments
- 💅 Plus lots of polish around caching and widget state management

**Breaking change:**

- 🛡️ We have temporarily disabled support for sharing static "snapshots" of Streamlit apps. Now that we're no longer in a limited-access beta, we need to make sure sharing is well thought through and abides by laws like the DMCA. But we're working on a solution!

## Version 0.46.0

_Release date: September 19, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- ✨ Magic commands! Use `st.write` without typing `st.write`. See
  https://streamlit.io/docs/api.html#magic-commands
- 🎛️ New `st.multiselect` widget.
- 🐍 Fixed numerous install issues so now you can use `pip install streamlit`
  even in Conda! We've therefore deactivated our Conda repo.
- 🐞 Multiple bug fixes and additional polish in preparation for our launch!

**Breaking change:**

- 🛡️ HTML tags are now blacklisted in `st.write`/`st.markdown` by default. More
  information and a temporary work-around at:
  https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/152

## Version 0.45.0

_Release date: August 28, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- 😱 Experimental support for _sidebar_! Let us know if you want to be a beta
  tester.
- 🎁 Completely redesigned `st.cache`! Much more performant, has a cleaner API,
  support for caching functions called by `@st.cached` functions,
  user-friendly error messages, and much more!
- 🖼️ Lightning fast `st.image`, ability to choose between JPEG and PNG
  compression, and between RGB and BGR (for OpenCV).
- 💡 Smarter API for `st.slider`, `st.selectbox`, and `st.radio`.
- 🤖 Automatically fixes the Matplotlib backend -- no need to edit .matplotlibrc

## Version 0.44.0

_Release date: July 28, 2019_

**Highlights:**

• ⚡ Lightning-fast reconnect when you do a ctrl-c/rerun on your Streamlit code
• 📣 Useful error messages when the connection fails
• 💎 Fixed multiple bugs and improved polish of our newly-released interactive widgets

## Version 0.43.0

_Release date: July 9, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- ⚡ Support for interactive widgets! 🎈🎉

## Version 0.42.0

_Release date: July 1, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- 💾 Ability to save Vega-Lite and Altair charts to SVG or PNG
- 🐇 We now cache JS files in your browser for faster loading
- ⛔ Improvements to error-handling inside Streamlit apps

## Version 0.41.0

_Release date: June 24, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- 📈 Greatly improved our support for named datasets in Vega-Lite and Altair
- 🙄 Added ability to ignore certain folders when watching for file changes. See the `server.folderWatchBlacklist` config option.
- ☔ More robust against syntax errors on the user's script and imported modules

## Version 0.40.0

_Release date: June 10, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- Streamlit is more than 10x faster. Just save and watch your analyses update instantly.
- We changed how you run Streamlit apps:
  `$ streamlit run your_script.py [script args]`
- Unlike the previous versions of Streamlit, `streamlit run [script] [script args]` creates a server (now you don't need to worry if the proxy is up). To kill the server, all you need to do is hit **Ctrl+c**.

**Why is this so much faster?**

Now, Streamlit keeps a single Python session running until you kill the server. This means that Streamlit can re-run your code without kicking off a new process; imported libraries are cached to memory. An added bonus is that `st.cache` now caches to memory instead of to disk.

**What happens if I run Streamlit the old way?**

If you run `$ python your_script.py` the script will execute from top to bottom, but won't produce a Streamlit app.

**What are the limitations of the new architecture?**

- To switch Streamlit apps, first you have to kill the Streamlit server with **Ctrl-c**. Then, you can use `streamlit run` to generate the next app.
- Streamlit only works when used inside Python files, not interactively from the Python REPL.

**What else do I need to know?**

- The strings we print to the command line when **liveSave** is on have been cleaned up. You may need to adjust any RegEx that depends on those.
- A number of config options have been renamed:

  ```eval_rst
  .. csv-table::
     :header: "Old config", "New config"
     :align: left

     "proxy.isRemote", "server.headless"
     "proxy.liveSave", "server.liveSave"
     "proxy.runOnSave, proxy.watchFileSystem", "server.runOnSave"
     "proxy.enableCORS", "server.enableCORS"
     "proxy.port", "server.port"
     "browser.proxyAddress", "browser.serverAddress"
     "browser.proxyPort", "browser.serverPort"
     "client.waitForProxySecs", "n/a"
     "client.throttleSecs", "n/a"
     "client.tryToOutliveProxy", "n/a"
     "client.proxyAddress", "n/a"
     "client.proxyPort", "n/a"
     "proxy.autoCloseDelaySecs", "n/a"
     "proxy.reportExpirationSecs","n/a"
  ```

**What if something breaks?**

If the new Streamlit isn’t working, please let us know by Slack or email. You can downgrade at any time with these commands:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade streamlit==0.37
```

```bash
$ conda install streamlit=0.37
```

**What’s next?**

Thank you for staying with us on this journey! This version of Streamlit lays the foundation for interactive widgets, a new feature of Streamlit we’re really excited to share with you in the next few months.
